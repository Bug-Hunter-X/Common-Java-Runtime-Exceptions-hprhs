# Common Java Runtime Exceptions

This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates three common runtime exceptions:

*   **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:** Occurs when attempting to access an array element using an invalid index (outside the bounds of the array).
*   **NullPointerException:** Occurs when attempting to access a member (method or field) of an object that is currently null.
*   **ArithmeticException:** Occurs when performing an illegal arithmetic operation, such as division by zero.

The code includes basic exception handling using `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle these exceptions and prevent program crashes.
